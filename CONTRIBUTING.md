# Contributing

All contributors are welcome to this project in the form of feedback, bug reports and even better pull requests.

## Issues

Issues are used to track **bugs**, **feature requests**, and other work.

_Before reporting a bug or requesting a feature, run a few searches to
see if a similar issue has already been opened and ensure youâ€™re not submitting
a duplicate._

### Bug reports

* Describe steps to reproduce
* Full error message if any
* Your code if relevant

_Of course you could propose a fix using pull request._

## Pull Request Guidelines

* Open a single Pull Request for each subject.
* Prefer to develop in a topic branch, not in `main` (`feature/name`, `fix/name`).
* Update documentation where applicable.
* If any bug related, add `#<id>` in commit message or pull request.

### Only touch relevant files

* Make sure your PR stays focused on a single feature or category.
* Don't change project configs or any files unrelated to the subject you're working.
* Don't reformat code you don't modify.

## Licensing

When submitting your first pull request, you will be asked to read the [CLA Document](CLA.md) and accept it.
